The secret to the human heart was always compassion and understanding. I've always been good with people, despite being an extrovert. My secret was always to show people compassion, genuine interest in them, their lives, understanding them, and most of all not judging them.
People most times already know that what they're doing is wrong, no need to pour salt onto their wounds. They need help with their pains, figuring out the root of the issue.
Many of us won't ever figure that out by our own, therefore it is good to be humble and receive support from other people, doing our best to throw away our ego, pride, and stubborness away. That way we could multiply our love and support towards others, and realize we need a doctor to heal our permanent pains, that no medicine can solve for good, but only way could solve it, to way to the truth.
